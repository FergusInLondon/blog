Yeah, it's that time of year... _again_.

After a couple of fairly chaotic years I'd really like to get in to the habit of actually (a) writing down more of my thoughts, and (b) sharing some of the things I've been working on. Hence a new blog.

This one is a bit more fully-featured and quite seamless to update, with automatic deployments and complete management via a single git repository. For more information check out the Colophon.

As previous attempts at blogging have all used Hugo, it should also be quite trivial to port old content across too. ðŸŽ‰
