This blog was built using open source software and is available in its entirety - content, configuration, and conversations - on GitHub.

Specifically, the site is generated using Hugo and the cocoa theme (with some _minor_ alterations).

All updates are automatically deployed via Cloudflare Pages, and all infrastructure (incl. DNS records) is managed via Terraform.

Discussions and reactions are powered via Giscus.
